## Netlify address of your research notebook.

https://sites.google.com/allegheny.edu/ai-watershed-delineation-cmpsc/home

## What is the reference of the article you choose?

“Remote Sensing and Geospatial Applications for Watershed Delineation”
https://www.isprs.org/proceedings/xxxiv/part1/paper/00080.pdf

## Explain why this article is meaningful to your work.

This article argues that “accurate delineation of a watershed plays
an extremely important role in the management of the watershed.”

They also mention that much of the topographic information available
is difficult to obtain, making this a good option to use.

Landscapes are always changing due to rainfall or other natural
occurrences, so it is important to keep up to date with information
on it, as well as making data easy to obtain and use.
